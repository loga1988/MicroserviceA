Service Discovery, Service Registry and Load Balancer Service Discovery is a mechanism which registers the service information in the service registry when the server is booting Service Registry -- information about a microservice like its Ip and port number Example : Lets say microservice A wants to talk to microservice B then first step it goes to the load balancer and load balancer reaches service discovery which in turn looks at service registry to get the ip and port details of microservice B once obtained the data from servuce discovery the load balancer decides where to route the request Client-Side Service Discovery Example: Netflix Eureka, Zookeeper, Consul -- querying service registry to find the microservices Server-Side Service Discovery : Amazon ELB -- find the microservices availability from service registry through router or load balancer

Service Discovery -- Service Provider + Service Registry + Service Consumer

Circuit Breaker : When a request fails to the service again and again then circuit breaker opens and halts all the requests to the service Closed State, Open State, Half-open state
